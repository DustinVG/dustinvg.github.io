<a href="https://mfgg.net/">Mario Fan Games Galaxy</a>
<br><br>
A website dedicated to creating freeware parodies of the Super Mario Bros franchise. It's been around for quite a long time. As of currently, I'm an administrator there.

<div class="link_2" align="center">
<a href="https://megamanmaker.com/">Mega Man Maker</a>
<br><br>
A Mega Man fangame designed to allow the user to create his or her own Mega Man levels, akin to Mega Man: Powered Up or Nintendo's Super Mario Maker. Technically speaking, I've only done a bit of trailer work for it,
but it's still really cool and it's made by a friend, so check it out.
