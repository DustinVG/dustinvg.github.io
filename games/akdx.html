<strong>Story</strong>
<br>
Long ago, the Mushroom Kingdom was founded by the mushroom people. This would, naturally, become the backdrop for the future adventures of the Mario brothers. However, things were tense in the early days of the kingdom. In an attempt to free themselves of what they considered unbearable conditions, a faction of toads willingly exiled themselves from the Mushroom Kingdom, to create their own nation. This country would become known as Sporalia.
<br><br>
Centuries later, however, and few remember this tale. The nation of Sporalia has fallen through the pages of history. But despite this, a legend has been spread by the historians dedicated enough to know about it:
that contained within the royal palace is treasure beyond speculation.

<strong>What is this?</strong>
<br>
Toad and the Ancient Keys is a small Metroidvania fangame that I (DustinVG) created back in 2016 for a competition. Emphasis on "small", as one could really beat it within twenty minutes tops. I thought about expanding upon it, but I also kinda wanted to keep it mostly in the same state it was released in, minus some quality of life improvements. That's where this project comes in.

Ancient Keys DX is a fangame that takes ideas and inspiration from the original Toad and the Ancient Keys and expands greatly upon them, with many new features and areas.
